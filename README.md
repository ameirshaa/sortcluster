Instructions
---------------------

Timepix folder contains the original code while Timepixeval contains the working code. After creating a code that works in Timepixeval, we save the changes to Timepix. Therefore, Timepixeval would contain the most recently updated codes. 

### How to use

> 1) Run createdatabase.py (this step is optional as I have done it and there is already a database.txt but it is up to you.)
> 2) Run threshold_and_matching.py (you should see a graph of some sort showing the amount of matches)
